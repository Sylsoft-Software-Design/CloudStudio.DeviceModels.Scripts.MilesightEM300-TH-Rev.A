	// This function allows you to convert a command from the platform 
	// into a payload to be sent to the device.
	// Learn more at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/200

	// The parameters in this function are:
	// - device: object representing the device to which the command will
	//   be sent. 
	// - endpoint: endpoint object representing the endpoint to which the 
	//   command will be sent. May be null if the command is to be sent to 
	//   the device, and not to an individual endpoint within the device.
	// - command: object containing the command that needs to be sent. More
	//   information at https://wiki.cloud.studio/page/1195.

	// This example is written assuming a device that contains a single endpoint, 
	// of type appliance, that can be turned on, off, and toggled. 
	// It is assumed that a single byte must be sent in the payload, 
	// which indicates the type of operation.
